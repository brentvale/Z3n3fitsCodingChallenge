##Setup Instructions

To fire this bad boy up, you can start by cloning this reposity and then running npm install.

If you don't already have http-server, you'll need to:

npm install -g http-server

In another terminal tab, you can now load the server by simply running

http-server.

Navigate to http://localhost:8080 and you should be all set to go!

##Making Changes

If you'd like to make changes to these widgets, you'll need to install webpack:

npm install webpack -g

Once that download completes, in a separate terminal tab, run webpack --watch, which will automatically re-complile your bundle.js when you make changes and save them.
